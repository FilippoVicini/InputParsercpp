## Task

The file payments.txt contains a simple textual table. Each line lists three pieces of
information: a person's name, an object name, and the price of the object purchased by the person,
separated by one space, e.g.:

```
Bob eggs 2.5
Alice apple 1.5
Ava pen 2
Bob pen 3.5
Alice eggs 2
```

The expected return for the sample file should be:

```
Bob eggs 2.5
Alice apple 1.5
Ava pen 2
Bob pen 3.5
Alice eggs 2
```
